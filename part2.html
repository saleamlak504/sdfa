         <p>Well, My Name is Salamlak Tassew and I am a student at Addis Abeba university institute of architecture, building construction and city development. I was born in mekdela amba, Ethiopia in 2001. I attended my primary and  secondary school at mekdela primary and secondary school. Now I am studying engineering at A.A university. Other than my education my hobby is to meet new peoples and have chat with them and I also like to travel to new places and wondering the thing that i discovered. In the future I want to be a great intellectual in many fields such as economics, theology, science and so on, and also encouraging and influencing people to follow their dreams.<br> Email Address:-salamlaktasew@gmail.com </p>
